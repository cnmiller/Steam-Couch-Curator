# Steam Couch Curator

Steam Couch Curator is a simple Python script for curating local (couch) multiplayer games from your Steam library. This script scrapes your personal Steam library and compares it against a local-multiplayer game database to quickly identifiy which games in your Steam library are local multiplayer capable.

## Requirements
